# Nested Test

Efficiency testing of nested functions vs. unnested functions in C. Precompiled with GCC.


## Compiling and Running
1a. In the nested-test directory, compile with GCC or compiler of your choice. With GCC:
```bash
gcc -o test test.c
```
1b. Alternatively, make the existing file executable. (Do this if not compiling your own)
```
chmod +x ./test
```
2. In the same directory, run command
```bash
./test
```
3. Stop code with CTRL + C.

## Expected Output
Program should loop endlessly displaying times of each test.
